## About

Discord bot which allows group members to vote on which music to add to a super playlist on spotify. It works by having users react to a recognised music
link (currently YouTube and Spotify links) with a üêê emoji and then
adds them to the spotify playlist. This allows regular music channels
in discords to still have music be queued but not necessarily added to
the master spotify playlist.

## Usage

Recommended way to deploy this bot is to create a free-tier VM
on Azure/GCP/AWS and host it as a NodeJS server.
